# Horiseon Code Refactored

## Description

This website is a refactored version of the original commit for Horiseon's SEO homepage mockup. The HTML tags have been switched for semantic div elements that make more sense to what the elements are on the page itself instead of just "div" tags and the classes have been simplified to what they are in relation to the page as well instead of seperate class tags for each object.

Also the pictures have been modified with alt descriptions to describe what each of them are to make the website more accessible. The title of the page has also been changed to reflect the company name and a brief description of the market the company exists in.
